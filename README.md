# SteamFakeUpdateFix
When you try to open a game on steam and it starts to "update" but turns out there ain't no update, this should fix it.

# Before you run the program, few things to keep in mind
1. Try removing your external HDD/SSD first, it might be a Steamworks Redist Update
2. Create Config.txt (case-sensitive) in the same place as the exe.

# Instructions
1.Create a Config.txt with the first line being the path to steamapps e.g: D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps
2.Launch the program
3.Enter the app id of the updating game/software.
4.It should hopefully fix it!
